## 🔥 Top Features

### 1. Magic Commits (`orca commit`)
No more `git add .` or straining to write "fix: bug". Orca analyzes your code changes and writes semantic, conventional commit messages for you.

```bash
D:\Projects\2026\Orca Shell\orca>orca commit
[orca commit]
[✓] Plan received

Proposed Plan:

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│   📋 Proposed Plan: 3 commits, 6 files
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

Commit #1 (3 files)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  📝 chore: Bump version and update license

  📄 Description:
  This commit updates the project version across `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `package.json` to `0.1.30`. Additionally, it changes the project license in `package.json` from MIT to Apache-2.0, aligning with broader open-source licensing standards.

    • Incremented project version from `0.1.29` to `0.1.30` in `cli/Cargo.toml` and `cli/package.json`.
    • Updated `orca` package version in `cli/Cargo.lock` to reflect the new project version.
    • Changed the project license from `MIT` to `Apache-2.0` in `cli/package.json`.

     IMPACT: LOW   These are metadata and build configuration changes. They affect the project's release versioning and legal terms but do not alter application runtime behavior or functionality.
              Affected: Project metadata, Build dependencies, Licensing

  📂 Files:
    │ cli/Cargo.lock
    │ cli/Cargo.toml
    │ cli/package.json

  ⚙️  Commands:
    $ git add -- cli/Cargo.lock cli/Cargo.toml cli/package.json
    $ git commit -m "chore: Bump version and update license"
